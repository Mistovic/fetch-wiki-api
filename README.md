## Task 1 - Design (30 minutes)
Take a look at the picture below and come up with suggestions on how this design could adapt to different devices (mobile, tablets etc).

## Task 2 - API consumption (1 hour)
Choose any public API (http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory is a good resource for finding one). Just use frontend code to get the data from the API and present it on a static HTML page (in a semantic way). Try and keep it simple and use native HTML, CSS and JavaScript without adding any external libraries and frameworks like Angular, React, Bootstrap and similar.
